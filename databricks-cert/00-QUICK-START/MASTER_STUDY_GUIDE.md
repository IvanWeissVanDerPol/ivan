## Exam Strategy Tips

### Before the Exam
1. **System Check**: Run technical requirements test
2. **Environment**: Quiet space, stable internet
3. **Materials**: Calculator, scratch paper (if allowed)
4. **Time Zone**: Confirm exam time in your timezone

### During the Exam
1. **Time Management**: ~2 minutes per question
2. **Flag Questions**: Mark difficult ones for review
3. **Read Carefully**: Watch for "NOT", "EXCEPT", "BEST"
4. **Eliminate Options**: Remove obviously wrong answers
5. **Code Syntax**: Pay attention to exact syntax

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Overthinking**: First instinct is often correct
2. **Time Traps**: Don't spend too long on one question
3. **Assumptions**: Use only information provided
4. **Versions**: Answers based on current Databricks version

## Quick Reference Sheets

### SQL Functions Cheat Sheet
```sql
-- Window Functions
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...)
RANK() OVER (...)
DENSE_RANK() OVER (...)
LAG(column, offset) OVER (...)
LEAD(column, offset) OVER (...)

-- Date Functions
DATE_ADD(date, days)
DATE_SUB(date, days)
DATEDIFF(end_date, start_date)
DATE_TRUNC('unit', timestamp)

-- Aggregations
COUNT(*), COUNT(DISTINCT column)
SUM(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX()
COLLECT_LIST(), COLLECT_SET()
PERCENTILE_APPROX()
```

### PySpark Essentials
```python
# DataFrame Operations
df.select("col1", "col2")
df.filter(col("age") > 21)
df.groupBy("category").agg(sum("amount"))
df.join(other_df, "key", "left")

# Performance
df.cache()
df.persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK)
df.repartition(200)
df.coalesce(10)

# Delta Operations
df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").save(path)
spark.read.format("delta").load(path)
deltaTable.merge(source, "condition").whenMatched().update()
```

### MLflow Quick Reference
```python
# Tracking
with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.log_param("param_name", value)
    mlflow.log_metric("metric_name", value)
    mlflow.log_model(model, "model_name")

# Model Registry
mlflow.register_model("runs:/run_id/model", "model_name")
client.transition_model_version_stage("model_name", version, "Production")
```
